**Employee Management System Overview**

*This project is a simple Employee Management System implemented using PHP, HTML, and MySQL. It allows users to manage employees and departments, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and includes basic styling.*

**Prerequisites**

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) installed on your machine to set up a local server.
- Basic understanding of PHP, HTML, and MySQL.

**Setup Instructions**

1. **Move to `htdocs` Directory:**
   - Copy or move the entire project folder (`employee-management-system`) to the `htdocs` folder inside your XAMPP installation.
   - If your project folder is named `dbproj`, the path should be `C:\xampp\htdocs\dbproj` (for Windows) or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/dbproj` (for Mac).

2. **Start XAMPP:**
   - Start the Apache and MySQL servers using the XAMPP control panel.

3. **Create Database:**
   - Open phpMyAdmin in your browser (usually http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
   - Create a new database named `dir`.

4. **Import SQL:**
   - Import the provided SQL script into the `dir` database. You can use phpMyAdmin for this.
     - File: `dir.sql`

5. **Run the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/dbproj/employee.php`.

**Database Tables**

1. **Employee Table:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       employee_ssn VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       salary DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
       department_id INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
   );
